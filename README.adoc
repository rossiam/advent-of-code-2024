== Advent of Code 2024

Solutions that are clearly better than Dan's, for sure, without a doubt, indubitably.

Versions written in TypeScript are run with https://docs.deno.com/runtime/[Deno].

For example,

[,sh]
----
$ cd typescript/day1
$ deno --allow-read part1.ts
----

Versions written in Rust are binaries named part1 and part2. (I'm just learning rust so please
judge, but not too harshly 😁.)

For example,

[,sh]
----
$ cd rust/day1
$ cargo run --bin part1
----
